# VGG-Coding-challenge
Design and create a web API to manage the following resources: Projects and Actions.

## Introduction

This is a simple "Project and Action" application for the VGG Coding Challange. It was built using the Python REST Framework for API CRUD operations and React for its frontend.

## Requirements to run thos Web Application
* Python3
* Pipenv

## Getting started
1. Clone the project to your machine ```[https://github.com/EzekielAdeyinka/VGG-Coding-challenge]```
2. Navigate into the diretory ```[cd Project_and_Action]```
3. Source the virtual environment ```[pipenv shell]```
4. Install the dependencies ```[pipenv install]```
5. Navigate into the frontend directory ```[cd frontend]```
5. Install the dependencies ```[npm install]```

## Run the application
You will need two terminals pointed to the frontend and backend directories to start the servers for this application.

1. Run this command to start the backend server in the ```[backend]``` directory: ```[python manage.py runserver]``` (You have to run this command while you are sourced into the virtual environment)
2. Run this command to start the frontend development server in the ```[frontend]``` directory: ```[npm install]``` (This will start the frontend on the adddress [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - A progressive JavaScript framework.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - A programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
* [Django](http://djangoproject.org/) - A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
